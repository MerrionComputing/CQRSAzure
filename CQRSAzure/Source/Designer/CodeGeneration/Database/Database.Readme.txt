Database
========

Creates the DBContext related classes to create the tables and foreign-key links needed to create an Event Stream backing store for the CQRS model 
which uses Azure SQL as it's backing store.

The table structure is that there is a core "Aggregate Event Stream" table which has fields to uniquely identify the aggregate instance,
the event type and sequence number.  There is then a separate table created for each event type specified for that aggregate which holds the additional
data properties of that event.

The SQL code generation will create DBSet entities for every aggregate in the model.  If you only want some of them backed by an SQL database (in a hybrid model)
then you will need to turn off the DBSet properties for that aggregate.
