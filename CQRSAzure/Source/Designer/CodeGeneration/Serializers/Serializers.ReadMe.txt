Serializers
===========

The code will generate serializers for each of the event classes in separate classes so that 
they can easily be swapped out if, for instance, you want to apply encryption while writing
some event data.

The event version number is also part of the serialiser class name as different versions may
have different properties.

This uses the serialisation/deserialisation attributes to control the serialisation process:
