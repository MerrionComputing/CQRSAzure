Aggregates are a way of uniquely identifying something about which you wish to keep information.

They can be an intrinsic property of the thing (for example a serial number for a computer, a three letter ISO code for a currency, 
or a user id for a person) or an identifier created for the thing - either as a globally unique identifier (GUID) or as an incremental number.

In the latter case some way to find the aggregate pertaining to the thing you want to check is needed.

Aggregates can be arranged in a hierarchy if the business domain is so arranged.  For example a hierarchy in financial 
services might be Client\Fund\Account.  

Because aggregates are used throughout the system it is recomended that each type of thing you are aggregating has its 
own interface defined - this allows the compiler to perform checks ratehr than you having to keep the rules for creating
an aggregate identifier in mind.
