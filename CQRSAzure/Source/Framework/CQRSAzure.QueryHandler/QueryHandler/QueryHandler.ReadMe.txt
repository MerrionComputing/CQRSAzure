Query Handlers
==============

The query handler is responsible for taking the query definition and parameters or settings contained therein,
and returning the result set as requested by that query.

In an event stream based system, this required the following steps:-
1) Get the aggregate identity group members the query pertains to
2) Run the query underlying projection over these members
3) Perform any collation part of the query
4) Return the resulting data

As the collation part is different for those quewries that want a data set (collection) to those that want a single
record there are two different base classes for each case.  The query definition has a property that is used to 
route between these alternatives.
