Overview
========

A query definition is a type-safe class that defines what parameter(s) can be passed into the query handler 
and what the expected return type consists of.

Each distinct definition will have one matching handler that will perform the actual querying and return of
data.

A query definition can be wrapped in an envelope to add entitlement information (who is asking the query) and 
any context used to handle the results.
