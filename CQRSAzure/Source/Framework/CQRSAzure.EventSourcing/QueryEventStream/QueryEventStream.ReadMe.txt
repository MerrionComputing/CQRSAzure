Query Event Stream
==================

The query event stream is a special event stream for each query which allows the life cycle of that query to 
be modellled as a stream of events.  The status of the query (and indeed the result set) can be read by running 
a projection over that event stream.

These are held in a namespace "Queries" to keep the logically distinct from the rest of the event sourcing framework
and not all systems will necessarily use an event stream backing for the commands 

The events that can occur to a query are:-
  QueryCreated - A new query was created 
  QueryStarted - A processor started work on the query
  QueryIdentityGroupRequested - A query asked for the membership of an identity group
  QueryIdentityGroupReturned - The members of the identity group were returned to a query
  QueryProjectionRequested - The query requested a projection to be run
  QueryProjectionReturned - A projection result was returned to the query
  QueryCompleted - Processing of the event completed successfully and normally

There are exception cases:-
  QueryTransientFaultOccured - A fault that may go away (such as available resources) occured
  FatalErrorOccured - An unrecoverable fault (such as an illogical query state) occured

If a query has a transient fault it may be requeued for processing in which case a QueryRequeued event is posted.
