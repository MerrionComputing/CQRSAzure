Command Event Stream
====================

The command event stream is a special set of event stream pertaining to the commands issued into a domain,
which are used to track the command life cycle (and status).

These are held in a namespace "Commands" to keep the logically distinct from the rest of the event sourcing framework
and not all systems will necessarily use an event stream backing for the commands

The events that can occur to a command are:-
  CommandCreated - A new command was created (from the point of view of the domain..it may in fact be an existing command passed in)
  CommandStarted - A processor started work on the command
  CommandStepCompleted - An atomic step in the command completed
  CommandCompleted - Processing of the event completed successfully and normally

There are exception cases:-
  CommandTransientFaultOccured - A fault that may go away (such as available resources) occured
  FatalErrorOccured - An unrecoverable fault (such as an illogical command) occured

If a command has a transient fault it may be requeued for processing in which case a CommandRequeued event is posted.
