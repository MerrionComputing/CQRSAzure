Azure Files
===========
Storage of an event stream in Azure files where :-

1) The aggregate type is turned into the file container identifier (effectively the file path)
2) Each event stream is a single file
3) The aggregate unique identifier is turned into the unique filename
4) The domain model is also used to get the azure storage account to use 

The file is initially created with a maximum size of 1Gb.

The event stream writer will take out an exclusive write lease on the file - this means that if the lease fails we know that someone else is
appending to the event stream and we must pass on our message to them or throw an error

Note that in most cases using Azure Blobs will be faster, and using SQL or Azure tables will be easier to code against 
so this is really only added for completeness.
