Azure SQL
=========

Storage of the event stream data in an Azure based SQL database

(Note that using a database will significantly reduce the scalability and parallelism so I would only recommend it for smaller or learning about CQRS scenarios)

The event stream itself is stored in one parent table for the common data and each event type has an additional table for its extra data.
