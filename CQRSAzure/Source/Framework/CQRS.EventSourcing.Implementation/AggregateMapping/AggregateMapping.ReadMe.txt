Overview
========

Aggregate mapping is the process of linking a specified aggregate class with the underlying technology used to 
provide its event stream and any projection caching technology.

It is to allow for a complete separation between the business side of the application (the Aggregates, Projections, Commands and Queries etc.)
and the data implementation layer so that they may be tested independently.

This link can be created by an application configuration file using <CQRSAzureEventSourcingConfiguration> desction:-

  ImplementationMaps:: Link between an aggregate class (with domain name) and it's underlying implementations
  Implementations:: Specific ways to store event streams (on azure or in memory)
