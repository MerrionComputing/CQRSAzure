Azure Tables
============

Storage of the event stream in Azure tables where:

1) The domain name and aggregate class are used to create the unique table name
2) The aggregate identifier is converted to a string and used as the table partition key
3) The event sequence number is converted to a string and used as the table row key
4) In order to prevent table scans a separate table is used to record the creation of new entities of any given class
being named [domain name] + Aggregates.
