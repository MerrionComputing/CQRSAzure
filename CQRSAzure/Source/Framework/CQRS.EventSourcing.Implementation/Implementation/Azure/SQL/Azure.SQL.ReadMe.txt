Azure SQL
=========

Storage of the event stream data in an Azure based SQL database

(Note that using a database will significantly reduce the scalability and parallelism so I would only recommend it for smaller or learning about CQRS scenarios)

The event stream itself is stored in one parent table for the common data and each event type has an additional table for its extra data.

The following properties can be configured in the configuration file for each SQl database backed event stream:-

 AggregateIdentifierField - What is the field name of the unique identifier of the aggregate in the table
 SequenceField - What is the name of the field holding the sequence number
 EventTypeField - What is the name of the field holding the event type
 EventVersionField - What field holds the event version number

 (Note: This implementation is not complete yet - I have left it in to be filled out when time allows)
