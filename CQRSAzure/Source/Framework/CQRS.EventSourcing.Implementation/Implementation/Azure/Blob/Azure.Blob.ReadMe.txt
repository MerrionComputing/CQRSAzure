Azure Blobs
===========

Storage of the event stream in Azure Blobs where:-

1) The aggregate type is turned into the blob container identifier
2) Each event stream is a single blob
3) The aggregate unique identifier is turned into the blob filename
4) The domain model is also used to get the azure storage account to use 

Since we do not need to update or delete records we will use Append Blobs ( See https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee691964.aspx )

The event stream writer will take out an exclusive write lease on the blob - this means that if the lease fails we know that someone else is
appending to the event stream and we must pass on our message to them or throw an error

The blob type used is an append-only blob ( see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs/ )
which fits well with the append-only nature of an event stream


URI - http://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<blob-name>  
where <container-name> = /[domain]/eventstreams/[aggregate-class-name]/

For projection snapshots, each snapshot is held as 

URI - http://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<blob-name>  
where <container-name> = /[domain]/snapshots/[aggregate-class-name]/
