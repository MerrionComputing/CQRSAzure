Local File
==========

Implementations backed by a local file store

This allows event streams to be stored in a source control system to "seed" any unit tests and also allows
local development and testing of the business rules in events/projections/queries etc.

Files are stored in a folder set in the settings (app.config) or if that is not supplied then they are saved in the LocalAppData
folder.

Event streams go in e.g.:-
{root}\{domain}\{aggregate name}\eventstreams\{key}.eventstream

Snapshots go in e.g. :-
{root}\{domain}\{aggregate name}\snapshots\{key}.snapshot.{as-of-sequence-number}
