Hosting
=======

Common functionality to allow multiple command handlers or multiple query handlers to be set up in a load-balanced configuration
so that they can hand off commands or queries and scale horizontally.

A host can forward on any message it receives if it decides that it is not best suited to handle a request, and the originator 
host identification is always held in the message so that the response can be directed straight back to the requester

The host needs to know the command, query and identity group queues for the domain so that it can take items off the queue and 
process them.

It also needs to know the configuration settings used to access teh underlying event streams and snapshots for the domain.
(A host can run multiple domains - although I suspect a 1-1 will be easier to understand in most cases)
