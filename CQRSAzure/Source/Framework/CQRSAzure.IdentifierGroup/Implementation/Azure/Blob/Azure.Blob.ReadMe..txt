Azure Blob Identifier Groups
============================

The Azure blob classifier uses an event stream data read by the standard Azure.Blob.EventStreamReader()

For the snapshots we have one blob per identity group with snapshots appended to the end when the snapshot is taken.  

The as-of date of the snapshot is held in the wrapper and the payload contains an enumerable list (potentially empty) of all the
aggregate keys that are considered "in" the group as at a given point in time.

Since we do not need to update or delete records we will use Append Blobs ( See https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee691964.aspx )
