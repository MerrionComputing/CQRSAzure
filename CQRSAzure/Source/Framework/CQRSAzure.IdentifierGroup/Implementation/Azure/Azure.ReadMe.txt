Implementations of the identifier group logic, based on the event stream readers that operate against the Microsoft Azure cloud platform

Note that because the aggregates that are either in or out of a particular identifier group have their own event streams with independent
sequence numbers it is not meaningful to use "sequence number" in an identifier group snapshot (unlike how this works for projections).
