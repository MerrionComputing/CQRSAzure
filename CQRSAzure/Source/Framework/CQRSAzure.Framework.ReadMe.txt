CQRS Framework
==============

Although event sourcing is not a mandatory part of CQRS, and indeed event sourcing is used outside of CQRS the two are often used together.  
In this project I am providing at an implementation that uses Windows Azure Storage (either Tables, Blobs or Files) as the persistence mechanism.

There is also a related project, CQRSAzure.Designer, which is a Visual Studio plug in designer (conceptually similar to the entity framework designer) 
which allows developers graphically to design the domain models of their CQRS system.  The code generated from these models can then be integrated
with this framework to host their data and process on an Azure storage back end.
