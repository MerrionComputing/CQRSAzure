Command Handler Configuration
=============================

In order to allow horizontal scaling the command handlers can be connected by registering them via a configuration setting to allow
commands received by one instance to be load balanced across all the available command handlers.

Note that although a CQRS command is one way from the input program's point of view, a command handler needs to know if the command has 
succeeded or not and, if not, to forward on the command to another handler to try

There are two sections pertaining to command handlers - the <CommandHandlerMapping> collection and the <CommandHandler> collection.
Each <CommandHandlerMapping> describes the relationship between a command definition and the handler class that is specified to deal with it
Each <CommandHandler> describes the additional configuration settings for that command handler
